# Neural Networks
TP2 for Artificial Intelligence Systems course from I.T.B.A.

## Pre-requisites
Execute the following line before executing Matlab/Octave
    export NEURAL_NETWORK_ROOT=`pwd`

## Execute
You can configure the desired activation function and simple perceptron
 example to be run at the `main.m` file.
Once you have finished, run that file to get the weights output of what
you have configured.

### Example
Executing the `main.m` file as it is will find the correspnding weights
 for both an `or` and an `and` simple perceptrons using a `unit step`
 activation function.
